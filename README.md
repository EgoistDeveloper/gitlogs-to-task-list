# gitlogs-to-task-list

This is a simple script to convert git logs to a task list. Then you can use the task list to generate a changelog or you can import it to a task management tool.

## Usage

```bash
ts-node index.ts
```

If you don't have `ts-node` installed, you can install it with `npm install -g ts-node typescript '@types/node`.
